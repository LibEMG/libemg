# In order to push to pypi we first need to build the binaries
# navigate to the project folder in the cmd
# run:
# python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
# you should have binaries specific to the new version specified in the setup.py file
# if you have other version binaries in the /dist folder, delete them.
# now to actually upload it to pypi, you need twine (pip install twine if you don't have it)
# now run:
# twine upload dist/*
