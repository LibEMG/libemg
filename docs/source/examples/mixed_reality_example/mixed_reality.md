One reason for the renewed interest in EMG as a general-purpose input modality stems from its inherent potential for mixed reality. With the continued advancement of mixed reality technology, myoelectric control may become desirable for several reasons due to its subtlety and convenience. In this example, we show how LibEMG can be leveraged to navigate a menu on the HoloLens 2. While this example is not a robust MR application, it's the foundation for future work to explore EMG in MR.

# EMG-Based Control

## Controls
The controls used for menu navigation are highlighted below:

| Control| Contraction |
| --- | --- |
| Scroll Up | Wrist Extension | 
| Scroll Down | Wrist Flexion |
| Open Menu | Hand Open | 
| Press Button | Finger Tap | 
| Do Nothing | Rest |

## Control Scheme
The file associated with the myoelectric control scheme in this example can be found in `emg_control.py`. The only difference compared to the previous examples is that we stream predictions from the classifier over TCP instead of UDP. We do this because the Hololens has better compatibility for TCP network communication. As shown, we are streaming over the network computer's IP and through port 8099.

```Python
# Step 5: Create online EMG classifier and start classifying.
IP = 'x.x.x.x' # Replace with computer IP 
# IP = '127.0.0.1' # Local host if running in editor
self.classifier = OnlineEMGClassifier(o_classifier, WINDOW_SIZE, WINDOW_INCREMENT, self.odh, feature_list, ip=IP, port=8099, tcp=True, std_out=True)
self.classifier.run(block=True)
```

# Hololens Support 
To develop the Hololens portion of the app, we leveraged the [MRTK](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/mixed-reality/mrtk-unity/mrtk2/?view=mrtkunity-2022-05), a toolkit to facilitate the development of MR systems on the Hololens. This gave us access to several predefined assets, such as menus and buttons. We created two scripts in this example: `MenuController.cs` and `MyoReaderClient.cs`. 

## Menu Controller
The menu implemented is simply a scrollable view consisting of ten button objects (from the MRTK). To turn the continuous predictions into more discrete events, the menu controller waits for five consecutive decisions before doing anything. Since the window increment is 20 samples and the sampling rate is 200 Hz, each action is at least 0.5s. Therefore, to open the menu, the user will have to keep their hand open for 0.5s. The goal was to reduce spurious false activations and enable the system to recognize discrete actions (e.g., hand open or wrist swipes) rather than continuous contractions.

```Python
void Update() {
    // First check for 5 consecutive actions
    if (emgReader.consecutive == 5) {
        if (emgReader.control == "4") {
            // Move Up - Flexion
            UpScroll();
        } else if (emgReader.control == "3") {
            // Move Down - Extension
            DownScroll();
        } else if (emgReader.control == "0") {
            // Hand close
            ButtonClick();
        } else if (emgReader.control == "1") {
            // Hand Open - Open.Close Menu
            menu.SetActive(!menu.activeSelf);
        }
        // Updates the button text color based on which is selected
        if (menu.activeSelf) {
            UpdateButtonColors();
        }
        // Reset - This acts as a bit of a debounce.
        emgReader.control = ""; 
        emgReader.consecutive = 0;
    }
}
```
## Myo Client 
To connect LibEMG to the Hololens, we stream predictions over TCP. When testing the application in the Unity editor, this entails one protocol (localhost), and for streaming to the Hololens it is another. This logic, which is split into the `#if UNITY_EDITOR` blocks, means the Myo Client script works in both cases. This script should remain relatively consistent if leveraged for a different use-case.
