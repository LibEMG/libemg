Due to the stochastic and transient nature of the EMG signal, the raw signal provides little information. As such, hand-crafted features are extracted from the underlying signal to increase its information density before being passed to the machine learning model. These features are extracted from windows (i.e., a predefined number of samples) of EMG. The selection of features (or feature sets) is essential for robust control systems.

This module aims to simplify the feature extraction stage for developers. We have included a number of features from the literature that we have robustly tested and validated. The following code snippet exemplifies how to extract features from raw EMG:

<details>
<summary><b>Example Code</b></summary>

```Python
import numpy as np
from libemg.feature_extractor import FeatureExtractor
from libemg.utils import get_windows

fe = FeatureExtractor()

# Load data from a csv file:
data = np.loadtxt("emg_data.csv", delimiter=",")
# Split the raw EMG into windows 
windows = get_windows(data, 50, 25)

# Extract a list of features
feature_list = ['MAV', 'SSC', 'ZC', 'WL']
features_1 = fe.extract_features(feature_list, windows)

# Extract a predefined feature group
features_2 = fe.extract_feature_group('HTD', windows)
```
</details>
<br/>

**Note that some features have parameters that must be tuned for a particular problem and hardware implementation.**

# Feature Performance
Each of the ~50 features that were implemented were tested individually with a linear discriminant analysis (LDA) classifier on the 3DCdataset. Note: some of these features are designed to improve robustness to factors (i.e., power line interference, limb position effect, contraction intensity variability), and as such, don't achieve high accuracy on their own for this gesture recognition task. Their value shouldn't be discounted when used in a rounded feature set for real-world use. The code associated with Figure 1 can be found in the example code tab below.

$


## **Temporal Moment (TM)** <sup>[1]</sup>
A temporal moment feature computed directly from the time domain. An order parameter is passed in that scales the signal prior to computing the moments. The zeroth order moment is the windowsize, the first order moment is like the MAV, and the second order moment is like the variance;therefore the feature should be used with order > 3 (this is set as the default).

\text{SM} =  \sum_{i=1}^{F} pow_{i}*f_{i}^{order}
$

## **Sample Entropy (SAMPEN)**
Sample entropy is a measure of the self-similarity within the signal. It captures nonlinear complexity information and is particularly useful for assessing contraction intensity, fatigue, or muscle tone. SAMPEN is computed using the log ratio of two "count" variables determined within the window, A and B. A represents the sum of all occurrances of each N-1 sample pattern that have distance less than r from all N-1 sample patterns. B is similar, however, it is the sum of all occurrences of each N sample patterns having a distances less than r. r is typically 0.2 * std, however, it can be changed as an argument of the library.

$ 
\text{SAMPEN} = -log \frac{A}{B}
$

## **Fuzzy Entropy (FUZZYEN)**
Fuzzy entropy similarly is a measure of self-similarity within the signal; however, it uses a similarity measure (continuous A from SAMPEN) between the N samples patterns instead of counting the occurences that strictly are less than the threshold (discrete A and B from SAMPEN). The similarity is computed by:

$
\text{FUZZYEN}=e^{\frac{-A^{d}}{r}}
$

where d and r are arguments to the function that correspond to the distance order and similarity threshold, respectively.

## **Discrete Time Fourier Transform Representation (DFTR)**

DFTR is a feature that computes the energy within 6 frequency bins of the EMG power spectrum (20-92, 92-163, 163-235, 235-307, 307-378, 378-450) Hz. If the frequency of the signal is less than these bins, then the bin is omitted (determined via a function argument).

$
\text{DFTR_{bin}} = \sum_{i \in bin} M_i
$


## **Integral Square Descriptor (ISD)**
Integral square descriptor captures the sum of the energy of the signal.

$
\text{ISD} = \sum x_i^2
$

## **Coefficient of Regularization (COR)**
The coefficient of regularization captures first and second order variability of the signal is inverse proportional to the energy in the signal.

$
\text{COR} = \frac{\sum \nabla x^2}{\sum \nabla^2 x^2 * \sum x^2}
$

## **Mean Difference Derivative (MDIFF)**
Mean difference derivative is computed by taking the sum of the first order variability of the signal.

$
\text{MDIFF} = \frac{\sum \nabla x^2}{N}
$

## **Mean Logarithm Kernel (MLK)**
Mean logarithm kernel is the log representation of the average absolute value of the signal.

$
\text{MLK} = \frac{log \sum |x|}{N}
$


## **Activation (ACT)**
The activation of the signal is the ISD feature normalized by the window size.

$
\text{ACT} = \frac{ISD}{N}
$

## **Mobility (MOB)**
Extract Mobility (MOB) feature. This feature is sqrt(m2/m0), where m0 and m2 are the first and second order moments found via
Parseval's theorem. Interestingly, the Gabor frequency tells us that the number of zero crossings per unit time can be described 
using 1/pi * mobility.

$
\text{MOB} = \sqrt{\frac{m2}{m0}}
$

## **Complexity (COMP)** 
This feature is sqrt(m4/m2), where m2 and m4 are the second and fourth order moments found via
Parseval's theorem. It is a measure of the the similarity of the shape of a signal compared to a pure sine waveform. Because the Gabor frequency 
tells us the number of zero crossings per unit time, the derivative of this metric gives us the number of extrema per unit time.

$
\text{COMP} = \sqrt{\frac{m4}{m2}}
$
