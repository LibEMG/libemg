# Classifiers

## Linear Discriminant Analysis 
A statistical linear boundary is used to discriminate between inputs. This is the standard for non-temporal models today.

## Support Vector Machines 
A hyperplane that maximizes the distance between classes is used as the boundary for recognition.

## Artificial Neural Networks 
A deep learning technique that uses human-like "neurons" to model data to help discriminate between inputs.

## Convolutional Neural Networks
A deep learning technique capable of self-extracting features from the underlying data.

## K-Nearest Neighbour
Discriminates between inputs using the K closest samples in feature space.

## Random Forest 
Uses a combination of decision trees to discriminate between inputs.

## Quadratic Discriminant Analysis
A statistical quadratic boundary is used to discriminate between inputs.
